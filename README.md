# api-orchestration
Fetches and displays the top 5 most popular posts with their details and comments from multiple API endpoints using vanilla JavaScript. Implements request throttling, timeout handling, and in-memory caching for optimized performance.

This project must be run using a Live Server (e.g., VSCode Live Server extension or a local server like http-server). Opening the HTML file directly in the browser (file:///) will not work properly due to restrictions on fetching data.
